                    <h2>The Sun</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Sun is a massive yellow dwarf star at the heart of our Solar
                        System, holding more than 99.8% of its total mass. Its energy is
                        produced by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium and
                        releasing immense amounts of heat and light. This energy drives
                        weather, climates, and ecosystems on Earth. The Sun's strong
                        gravity keeps planets, moons, comets, and asteroids in orbit. Its
                        surface, called the photosphere, reaches about 5,500¬∞C, while the
                        core is millions of degrees hot. Solar flares and coronal mass
                        ejections can affect Earth's space environment, sometimes
                        disrupting satellites and communications.

                    <h2>Mercury</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mercury is the smallest planet and the closest to the Sun,
                        orbiting once every 88 days. With virtually no atmosphere, it
                        cannot retain heat, resulting in extreme surface temperatures
                        ranging from scorching hot during the day to freezing cold at
                        night. The surface is covered with craters, resembling Earth‚Äôs
                        Moon, because it lacks geological activity to renew itself.
                        Despite its small size, Mercury has a dense iron-rich core, making
                        it the second densest planet after Earth. It has no moons or
                        rings. NASA‚Äôs MESSENGER mission revealed much about its
                        composition, thin exosphere, and surprising traces of water ice
                        near its poles.

                    <h2>Venus</h2>
                    <p>
                        Venus is often called Earth‚Äôs twin because of its similar size and
                        composition, but its conditions are drastically different. The
                        planet has a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and clouds of
                        sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes
                        Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System. Surface temperatures
                        can reach 465¬∞C, hot enough to melt lead. The pressure on Venus is
                        about 90 times stronger than Earth‚Äôs at sea level. Its surface
                        features volcanoes, mountains, and vast lava plains. Despite these
                        harsh conditions, Venus fascinates scientists as a key to
                        understanding atmospheric dynamics, greenhouse effects, and
                        planetary evolution.

                    <p>
                        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world to
                        support life. About 71% of its surface is covered by water, which
                        plays a crucial role in regulating climate and sustaining
                        ecosystems. Its atmosphere, composed mainly of nitrogen and
                        oxygen, provides breathable air and shields the planet from
                        harmful solar radiation. Earth‚Äôs dynamic geology results in
                        mountains, earthquakes, and volcanoes, while its magnetic field
                        protects it from solar winds. The planet‚Äôs single natural
                        satellite, the Moon, influences tides and stabilizes Earth‚Äôs tilt.
                        Earth‚Äôs diversity of life and habitats makes it unique among all
                        planets discovered so far. Earth is said to be only planet suitable for lives.

                    <p>
                        The Moon, Earth‚Äôs only natural satellite, is about one-quarter the
                        size of Earth. Its surface is marked by craters, volcanic plains,
                        and mountain ranges, shaped by billions of years of impacts. The
                        Moon plays a vital role in stabilizing Earth‚Äôs axial tilt, which
                        helps regulate climate. It also causes tides through gravitational
                        interaction with Earth‚Äôs oceans. The Moon has no atmosphere or
                        liquid water, making its surface vulnerable to space weathering.
                        Humans first visited the Moon in 1969 during NASA‚Äôs Apollo 11
                        mission. Future missions plan to establish a sustainable presence,
                        potentially using it as a gateway for deep-space exploration.

                        Mars, the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun and has
                        long fascinated humans with the possibility of past or present
                        life. Its reddish color comes from iron oxide (rust) on its
                        surface. Mars has the tallest volcano, Olympus Mons, and the
                        deepest canyon, Valles Marineris, in the Solar System. Its
                        atmosphere is thin and mostly carbon dioxide, making it cold and
                        unable to support liquid water on the surface for long. However,
                        evidence suggests ancient rivers, lakes, and possibly oceans once
                        existed. Mars has two small irregular moons, Phobos and Deimos,
                        and is the target of numerous exploration missions.

                    <h2>Uranus</h2>
                    <p>
                        Uranus is an ice giant distinguished by its unique sideways
                        rotation. Unlike other planets, it rotates on its side, likely due
                        to a massive collision in the past. This extreme tilt causes
                        unusual seasons, each lasting over 20 years. Uranus‚Äôs pale
                        blue-green color comes from methane in its atmosphere, which
                        absorbs red light. Its atmosphere is made up of hydrogen, helium,
                        and icy methane, with winds reaching up to 900 km/h. Uranus has 27
                        known moons and faint rings. Despite being a giant, Uranus is
                        often called the ‚Äúforgotten planet‚Äù because it has been visited
                        only once by Voyager 2 in 1986.

                    <h2>Neptune</h2>
                    <p>
                        Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, known for its deep
                        blue color caused by methane in its atmosphere. It is similar to
                        Uranus but more active, with the fastest winds in the Solar
                        System, sometimes exceeding 2,000 km/h. Neptune‚Äôs atmosphere is
                        dynamic, with large storms, including the Great Dark Spot observed
                        by Voyager 2 in 1989. The planet has 14 known moons, the largest
                        being Triton, which has geysers that spew nitrogen and orbits in
                        the opposite direction of Neptune‚Äôs rotation, suggesting it was
                        captured. Neptune remains a frontier for exploration, as no
                        spacecraft has orbited it yet.
